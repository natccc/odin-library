# ðŸ“š Library App  

A small library management app built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum.  
The app is made with **Vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on object constructors, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features  
- **Add a book** using a dialog modal form (title, author, pages, read status).  
- **Toggle read status** of a book (switch between *Read* and *Unread*).  
-  **Remove a book** from the library.  
-  **Display all books** in a table with dynamic rendering.  
-  Built with **Object Constructor** pattern (Book objects stored in an array).
